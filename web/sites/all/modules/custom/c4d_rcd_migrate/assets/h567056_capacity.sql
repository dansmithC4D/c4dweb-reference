This does not require ownership (i.e. long term leases or short term ones that&nbsp; are&nbsp; routinely&nbsp; renewed&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as&nbsp; group&nbsp; rights also qualify). Security&nbsp; implies&nbsp; that&nbsp; an individual&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; deprived&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; or&nbsp; her&nbsp; land&nbsp; rights involuntarily. This&nbsp; normally&nbsp; requires that duration, subject, and object of rights are clearly defined. For the latter, physical markers or a map or sketch (not necessarily a high precision survey) that shows the parcel&rsquo;s position relative to others is normally needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Legally recognized&nbsp; documentation: The most&nbsp; common&nbsp; type&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; documentation&nbsp; are ownership&nbsp; documents&nbsp; (titles or&nbsp; deeds) issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; a government institution.&nbsp; Other&nbsp; types&nbsp; of documents&nbsp; (tax&nbsp; receipts,&nbsp; utility&nbsp; bills,&nbsp; private&nbsp; contracts confer legal recognition in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sense that they can be used as evidence of rights in a court of law. This implies that a continuum of documentary&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; needs&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; recognized.&nbsp; For&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; constructing&nbsp; the&nbsp; indicator, reference&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; made&nbsp; to&nbsp; formal&nbsp; and&nbsp; informal&nbsp; documents -the&nbsp; former&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; from administrative&nbsp; records&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; from&nbsp; household&nbsp; surveys&nbsp; that&nbsp; are&nbsp; cross-checked&nbsp; with formal records. Perceived&nbsp; security&nbsp; of&nbsp; tenure: perceptions&nbsp; of&nbsp; tenure&nbsp; are deemed to&nbsp; be&nbsp; secure&nbsp; if&nbsp; an individual&nbsp; or household&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; feel&nbsp; a&nbsp; threat&nbsp; of&nbsp; being&nbsp; deprived&nbsp; of&nbsp; legitimately&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; use&nbsp; or&nbsp; ownership rights&nbsp; to&nbsp; land&nbsp; or&nbsp; of&nbsp; these&nbsp; rights&nbsp; being&nbsp; disputed&nbsp; by&nbsp; others (either&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; or individuals). Perceived security is important in settings where formal documentation does not exist or where, largely due to gaps in institutional quality or the transparency with which land records&nbsp; are administered,&nbsp; formal&nbsp; documents&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; increase&nbsp; tenure&nbsp; security. It&nbsp; is thus&nbsp; an important&nbsp; complement&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; indicator with&nbsp; recognition&nbsp; that methodological&nbsp; study&nbsp; of the extent to which perceptions can be captured will be desirable.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMethod of Computation:<br />\r\nThis&nbsp; as an outcome indicator to be divided in two parts: (A) measures the incidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; people&nbsp; with&nbsp; secure&nbsp; tenure&nbsp; rights&nbsp; over&nbsp; land&nbsp; among&nbsp; the&nbsp; total&nbsp; population; while&nbsp; (B)&nbsp; focuses&nbsp; on the&nbsp; perceived&nbsp; secure rights&nbsp; to&nbsp; land&nbsp; among&nbsp; the&nbsp; population&nbsp; or communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part&nbsp; (A)&nbsp; and&nbsp; part&nbsp; (B)&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; seen&nbsp; as&nbsp; two&nbsp; different&nbsp; indicators,&nbsp; they rather provide two complementary pieces of information with the second (B) putting more&nbsp; emphasis&nbsp; on&nbsp; documenting&nbsp; secure&nbsp; tenure&nbsp; rights&nbsp; through&nbsp; the&nbsp; perception&nbsp; of&nbsp; the communities or individuals communally using land. These two parts can be computed using&nbsp; similar&nbsp; data,&nbsp; albeit&nbsp; with&nbsp; varying denominators&nbsp; (due&nbsp; to&nbsp; computation differences of deriving populations affected from communities/households). Part (A):&nbsp; {People (adult) with secure rights over land / Total adult populations surveyed } x 100 Part (B): { People (adult) who perceive their land rights to be secure / Total adult population in households or communities surveyed} x 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final combined or aggregate figure will be a combination of the numerators of A and&nbsp; B&nbsp; divided&nbsp; by&nbsp; their&nbsp; combined&nbsp; and&nbsp; respective&nbsp; denominators&nbsp; (computed&nbsp; as&nbsp; total number&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; adult&nbsp; population&nbsp; surveyed&nbsp; or&nbsp; those&nbsp; in&nbsp; households&nbsp; or&nbsp; communities surveyed).&quot;</p>\r\n', '<p>1) National Statistical Agencies- Surveys and Administrative records&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)World Bank, International Household Survey Network - Household surveys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)World&nbsp; Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp; &lsquo;Doing Business; survey- Administrative data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) UN-Habitat- Urban Indicator Database</p>\r\n', 'Primary and secondary data', '0');

PHL profiles are specific to crop type, climate type and to the type of farm (smallholder or larger scale farming). One problem faced in seeking to provide PHL profiles is, that for many provinces there are no specific PHL data. It is therefore inevitable that many different provinces have to share the same data. This was achieved by clustering together the provinces of many countries that are basically similar with respect to the factors that influence PHLs; the most convenient method of doing this is regrouping of provinces according to climate classification, namely by tropical savannah, hot semi-arid, humid subtropical and subtropical highlands. As a result for each crop there is a PHL profile for each climate and farm type, so with eight crops there is a total of 36 profiles.<br />\r\nSeasonal data -&nbsp; Several &lsquo;seasonal&rsquo; factors are taken into account in the loss calculation and these have a very significant bearing on the actual loss estimate.&nbsp; They are contributed by the APHLIS network members and include 1) whether or not there is damp weather at time of any of the harvests which would make drying difficult, 2) the proportion of grain that is marketed within the first three months, so will not enter farm storage for any significant time, 3) the length of the farm storage period, and 4) in the case of maize, whether or not LGB (Prostephanus truncatus) is expected to be a significant pest ( Source: African postharvest losses information system: http://www.aphlis.net/)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nType of data disaggregation: By type of product</p>\r\n', '<p>1) Project-commissioned studies at the beginning and end of implementation,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) African Postharvest Losses information System, http://www.aphlis.net/</p>\r\n', 'Primary and secondary data', '0'), ('325', '43', '8399', 'Minimum Dietary Diversity – Women and adolescent girls (MDD-W))', 'The Dietary Diversity Score (DDS)  Ranging from 0-10', '<p>Indicator Definition: MDD-W is a dichotomous indicator of whether or not women 15-49 years of age have consumed at least five out of ten defined food groups the previous day or night.

This survey can be implemented during the preparation of the project within the environmental and social impact analysis.<br />\r\nOption B (when household survey not available)<br />\r\n1) The main determinant for calculating the number of people shall be the published population density (region/province or if not available, country) in which the projects were implemented. i.e. persons per square km.<br />\r\n2) For roads in the countryside (remote areas or rural areas) - this figure of the population density shall be multiplied with the length of the road (km) under evaluation and then multiplied by 4km (i.e. 2km either side of the road). (the formula to be applied then is : population density x length of road x 42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) For roads linking major cities/towns/commercial centres &ndash; in addition to calculating the population along the road in between the cities as indicated above, a proportion of the population of the cities concerned shall also be calculated and apportioned to the total number of the people with all access to weather roads. This is to take into account the trade opportunities between the city communities that is created by the construction, rehabilitation or maintenance of the road joining them. This portion of the population is determined by the total number of road links the concerned city is linked to other cities or major trading centers. If for example the road under assessment is the only link between the city and any other cities in the country then the total population of the city is taken. However, if the city in question is also linked by other roads to other cities then the population of the city will be divided by the number of roads links the city has. In order to simplify the calculation only cities with populations that are equal to or greater than 100 000 people will be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nType of data disaggregation: Sex</p>\r\n', '<p>Project and programme monitoring systems</p>\r\n', 'Primary and secondary data ', '0'), ('372', '43', '8378', 'Number of hectares of arable land under irrigation thanks to EU support', 'Square KM (Sq.
